Mission Statement

The mission of the Caribbean Center for Collective Intelligence (CC4CI) is to conduct research exploring how functional modeling can be used to create a new form of “general” collective intelligence more capable of discovering solutions that are collectively optimal for groups for more problems in general. The mission of the CC4CI is also to conduct research on how that more general collective intelligence might be leveraged to massively or even exponentially increase impact on most, or even any targeted collective outcomes, whether related to social, economic, environmental, or other aspects of collective well-being. Eventually these research efforts will extend to problem-solving related challenges in mathematics, physics, economics, engineering, medicine or other academic disciplines.




The initial mission of the CC4CI is to launch a number of projects aimed at creating the capacity to massively increase positive societal, economic, environmental, and other impacts through this new form of collective intelligence. These projects are: launching a “Change the World University Challenge”, implementing the first complete semantic representation of information calle the “conceptual space”, implementing some subset of features of a “General Collective Intelligence” or GCI platform, differentiating the different forms of group intelligence in order to build awareness of the different problems each solves, studying the role of deployment networks in making deployment of federated intelligence at scale feasible, and studying the role of federated intelligence in what I call the technology gravity well effect.




The mission of the CC4CI is also to explore what concepts and reasoning currently live on “cognitive deserts” that aren’t reliably reachable by groups, and therefore can’t reliably be spread even where they might be solutions to our greatest challenges. The CC4CI will explore how a GCI platform could help reach them. For example, the concept of a General Collective Intelligence platform is very hard for most people to grasp, but to people with an interest in federated intelligence it might come more naturally. Spreading the concept to groups with a background in federated intelligence might then create a bridge to the cognitive desert where the concept of GCI platforms resides. Similarly, the importance of federated intelligence in areas like privacy and security is also very difficult for people to grasp, but with an understanding of the concept of GCI platforms, it might come naturally as well.
